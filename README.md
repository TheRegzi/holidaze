## Overview

This is my submission for the Project Exam 2 at my Front-end Development studies at Noroff. This project showcases my skills learned over the course of the last two years.
Holidaze is a web app for viewing, booking and creating holiday venues. The application communicates with an existing API to handle the venue data. There are two roles to register as; Regular customer and Venue manager. A venue manager can add, edit and delete their own venues, in addition to the other abilities the regular customers have; creating bookings at venues and editing their profile.

## Goal

Create a functional, user-friendly front-end holiday website that integrates with the Noroff API to manage venues, view bookings, and user accounts.

## Features

- All users can view a list of newest venues, and search for venues with location, dates to be booked and the number of guests.
- All users can view a specific venue by id, and see the available dates marked in a calendar.
- Registration: Users with a stud.noroff.no email address can register for the platform; either as a Customer or a Venue manager.

### For Regular Customers:

- Can create bookings at other venues made by venue managers.
- View their upcoming bookings on their profile page.
- Edit their profile by updating their avatar image and banner image.
- Login and Logout: Users can securely log in and out of their accounts.

### For Venue Managers:

- Create their own venues.
- Can update and delete a venue they manage.
- Can view upcoming bookings at a venue they manage in a table on the specific venue page.
- Edit their profile by updating their avatar image and banner image.
- View a list of both their own venues and upcoming bookings on the profile page.

## Technologies Used
